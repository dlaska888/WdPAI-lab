## Getting Started

The app will be hosted on a server in the future. As of PR#1, you can clone the repository and run the app locally - see [Installation](#installation).

## Installation

Pre-requisites:
 - docker installed

Run the following commands in the root directory of the project:

```docker compose up```

Or if you want to run it in the background:

```docker compose up -d```

## Usage

As of PR#1, you can interact with the app without having to log in. Not all features are implemented yet, but you can interact with a "view" version of the app - navigate between pages, toggle and scroll through bookmarks.

## Contributing

Yet to be determined.
